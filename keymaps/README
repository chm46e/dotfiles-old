My customized keymap, that makes using my 60% keyboard a little easier.

Changes:
    Inverts [] and {} (as for c coding, {} is used a lot more)
    Inverts '' and "" (as double quotes are better:D )
    Changes key (\ and |) to be (/ and \)
    Changes key (/ and ?) to be (| and ?)

To use (as root):
    (the file locations may be different) (tested on fedora)
    mv /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us_old
    cp us /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us

    (restart)
