NB: These configs can result in a kernel panic in your machine, please look over them first.

.config.master:
    -> Kernel config that I mainly use
    -> Includes as little support as possible

.config.maxsup:
    -> Kernel config that tries to include as much support as possible 
    (not quite complete)

.config.batopt:
    -> Kernel config that includes a couple of battery friendly options

To use:
    > cp <config> /path/to/kernel
    > make menuconfig
    $$ change general->build id salt to the kernel version
    $$ at min look inside: file systems, processor, general
    > sudo su
    > make -j<core count> ; make -j<core count> modules_install ; make -j<core count> install
