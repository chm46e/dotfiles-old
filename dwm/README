As siduck76 had some stuff already that I wanted, I decided to fork it and customize.
Thank you again coder, very cool.
Repo:
    https://github.com/siduck76/chadwm

To use:
    $$ Move .dwm to ~/.dwm
    sudo make clean install
    $$ Create an entry in /usr/share/xsessions/ that executes /home/<user>/.dwm/autostart
